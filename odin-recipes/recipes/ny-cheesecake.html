    <h2>New York-Style Cheesecake</h2>
    <p>
      This is my favorite recipe for New York-style cheesecake, and includes a
      great technique for letting the citrus-kissed cake finish in the oven, so
      that no crack forms when the cake cools.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>18 graham crackers</li>
      <li>crushed ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
      <li>
        Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a bowl until evenly
        moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2-inch up the
        sides of the springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk flour, sour cream, and vanilla extract in bowl. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Stir cream cheese and sugar with a wooden spoon in a large bowl until
        evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour milk into cream cheese mixture and whisk until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until
        just incorporated. Step 9 Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the
        surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center
        that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the
        oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top
        of the cheesecake.
      </li>
    </ol>
